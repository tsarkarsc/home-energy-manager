# home-energy-manager

This is an interactable high fidelity prototype of an Android based home automation app used for energy monitoring and management. It was made using the JustInMind prototyper for a UI/UX focused Human-Computer Interaction course at Seneca. Design goals were based on Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics for UI design and Don Norman's Design Principles.
